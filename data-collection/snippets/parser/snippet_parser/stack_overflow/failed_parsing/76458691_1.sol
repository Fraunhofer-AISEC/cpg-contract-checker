Conversion of type 'Contract' to type 'FundMe' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type 'BaseContract & Omit<ContractInterface, keyof BaseContract>' is missing the following properties from type 'FundMe': attach, deployed, functions, MINIMUM_USD, and 9 more.
