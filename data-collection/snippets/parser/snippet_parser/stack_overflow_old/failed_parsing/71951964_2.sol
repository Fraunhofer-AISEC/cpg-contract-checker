  1) Contract: Wallet
       should create transfers:
     Transaction: 0xd41ddeb4f3801cd59e065679a8a26180d92aa31778704e16ccfde77e01b9d830 exited with an error (status 0) after consuming all gas.
     Please check that the transaction:
     - satisfies all conditions set by Solidity `assert` statements.
     - has enough gas to execute the full transaction.
     - does not trigger an invalid opcode by other means (ex: accessing an array out of bounds).
  StatusError: Transaction: 0xd41ddeb4f3801cd59e065679a8a26180d92aa31778704e16ccfde77e01b9d830 exited with an error (status 0) after consuming all gas.
