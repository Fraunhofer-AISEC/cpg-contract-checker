Pos: 63:4: Gas costs: Gas requirement of function TestAnte.GetHctAnte is infinite:
 If the gas requirement of a function is higher than the block gas limit, 
 it cannot be executed. Please avoid loops in your functions or actions 
 that modify large areas of storage (this includes clearing or copying arrays in storage) 

Pos: 88:24: Data truncated: Division of integer values yields an integer value again. 
 That means e.g. 10 / 100 = 0 instead of 0.1 since the result is an integer again. 
 This does not hold for the division of (only) literal values since those yield 
 rational constants.
