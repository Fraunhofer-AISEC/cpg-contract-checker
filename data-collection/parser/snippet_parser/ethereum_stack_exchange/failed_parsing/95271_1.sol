# now you can play with your code. Let’s define the SMTP server separately here:
port = 2525 
smtp_server = "smtp.mailtrap.io"
login = "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g" # paste your login generated by Mailtrap
password = "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g" # paste your password generated by Mailtrap

# specify the sender’s and receiver’s email addresses
sender = "from@example.com"
receiver = "mailtrap@example.com"

# type your message: use two newlines (\n) to separate the subject from the message body, and use 'f' to  automatically insert variables in the text
message = f"""\
Subject: Hi Mailtrap
To: {receiver}
From: {sender}

This is my first message with Python."""

    # tell the script to report if your message was sent or which errors need to be fixed 
    print('Sent')
