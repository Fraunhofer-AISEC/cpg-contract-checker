Understanding integers
Integers help in storing numbers in contracts. Solidity provides the following two types of integer:

• Signed integers: Signed integers can hold both negative and positive values.
• Unsigned integers: Unsigned integers can hold positive values along with zero. They can also hold negative values apart from positive and zero.
